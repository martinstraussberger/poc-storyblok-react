# POC Headless CMS - Storyblok & React

This repository serves as a small Proof of Concept (POC) for utilizing Storyblok with React. It demonstrates the integration of Storyblok with custom React components, allowing for easy content management through the Storyblok Visual Editor.

## Features

-   **Custom components**: can be edited and managed through the Storyblok Visual Editor. These components provide flexibility and allow designers, the marketing team, or other departments to manually edit the content without the help on developers. Which reduces the workload on the Developer Team.
-   **Developer**: ownership of the codebase while enabling non-technical teams to make content changes. It streamlines the content management process, empowering different departments to update and modify the website content.

## Getting Started

To initialize this project, follow these steps:

1.  `npm install` to install all required dependencies
2.  Local development server setup: 
	- The local development server requires an HTTPS proxy to mirror the Storyblok Visual Editor with the custom React components. [Storyblok Dev Server HTTPS Proxy Setup](https://www.storyblok.com/faq/setup-dev-server-https-proxy)

## Note

This Storyblok React POC demonstrates the potential of utilizing Storyblok for content management in a React application. By leveraging the Storyblok Visual Editor and custom React components, developers can maintain code ownership while enabling non-technical teams to make content edits easily. This approach enhances collaboration between developers, designers, and other departments, streamlining the content management process and accelerating website updates.
